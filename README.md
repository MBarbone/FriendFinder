# FriendFinder

### Description
Friend Finder is an app designed to help match you with your most compatible friend from the Friend Finder userbase. The user responds to a ten question personality survey with values ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). When the survey is submitted, an existing user record closest to the current user's responses is found and returned. The closest set of user responses is defined as the set with the lowest absolute difference for all ten questions combined.

### Demo
Friend Finder is deployed to Heroku. Please check it out here.
